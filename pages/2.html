      <div class="post-title"><a href="../posts/2011-1-24-7-28-silly-apple-ui.html">silly apple ui</a></div>
      <div class="post-date">January 24, 2011</div>
      <p>I have been working my way through the Stanford iOS programming course. It’s been my biggest exposure to the Apple developer ecosystem. So far I have encountered three user interface components in the tooling that I trip me up. The first is Interface Builder (IB). This tool is separate from the XCode IDE. I typically forget to save changes. In my mind XCode and IB are one and so I expect my changes to be saved when I build. I usually end up with a blank screen and then I remember: save in IB! In XCode 4 IB is supposed to be integrated so hopefully this issue is fixed. On the code side of things all the UI pointers are nil. In Objective C it is perfectly valid to send messages to those nil objects. Personally, I would like to fail fast and have the program crash as I think that would help me find the root cause quicker. Second, when opening older projects I often get the “Base SDK is missing” error. It’s easy to change in the project’s build settings but after the change it seems you must reload the project in XCode. It wasn’t entirely obvious at first but restarting an application usually fixes everything regardless of the platform. Finally, I wanted to see how my custom drawRect: code was visually different on the retina display versus the old display. I checked out an older device from work and took it too my office and tried to provision only to receive this error message:</p>
<p><img alt="silly ui" src="../static/img/silly-apple-ui.png" /></p>
<p>Only one developer gets to register a device I figured. I searched the internet a bit and finally decided I would just provision the device as a tester’s device. While I was looking for the page to do that I found my device list had two devices listed. That was odd because I only expected to see my iPod listed. I looked at the second device and sure enough it had the same ID number as the device I had checked out. The dialog meant to add devices didn’t tell me it had done this. It only displayed an error message asking for another ID number. Overall the tooling is pretty good and it does not get in the way that often.</p>

      <div class="post-title"><a href="../posts/2011-1-17-7-28-facebook-ads.html">facebook ads</a></div>
      <div class="post-date">January 17, 2011</div>
      <p>If Facebook ads are any indicator of the health of the economy then it must be great. For the past 2-3 months I have noticed an increase in the number of job ads. I think the cause might be one or a combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>More employers are using Facebook to advertise open positions which could mean the economy is doing better. Yay!</li>
<li>I switched jobs from a Visual Studio SDET to Bing Mobile SDE back in October. The “developer” label probably draws more employer attention than the “tester” label.</li>
<li>The Microsoft keyword in my profile certainly helps. It’s like going to a big name school. Society assumes it must be good. In the big scheme of things it’s pretty silly to base potential success off of that attribute alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the job ads I have seen so far:
<em> <imdb.com>
</em> <logos.com>
<em> Various social game sites like <wooga.com> and <zynga.com>
</em> <palantir.com>
<em> <inrix.com>
</em> <marchex.com> - they advertise using the domain <makehistory.com> which appears to be their informational recruiting site. </p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for 2 or 3 of these to show up on any given Facebook page. The Marchex ad always catches my eye. Their tag line reads: “Tired of Reorgs.” Which probably catches the attention of most Microsoft employees. I think ads on Facebook are going to start to look more and more like this though. They will continue to get more personal in nature. I know I click on more Facebook ads than Google ads. When something is so relavent it sparks my curiosity. I don’t know that Facebook will take away Google’s AdWord revenue but I think they are in a pretty good position to compete for AdSense revenue.  IMDB.com also advertises positions on Facebook. They didn’t take the “reorg” approach but went with the commute. The 520 bridge which connects Seattle to Microsoft can get backed up. Personally, I am not “tired of the bridge” as their ad said since I don’t live in Seattle. Their ad was clever but not clever enough to take my address into account.  Finally, the last ad that caught my eye had the tag line: “Stressed At Microsoft?” The ad was for counseling services at <eastsidecounseling.org>. Between the competitor’s job ads and counseling ads a cynic might say Microsoft isn’t the place to work.  I wonder what kind of targeted ads I would see if I worked at Google, Amazon, Facebook or Apple? For Amazon I am guessing “Tired of the Pager” would make a pretty catchy tag line. I am sure the others have quirks their competitors use to attract talent but I don’t know enough about those companies to venture a guess.</p>

      <div class="post-date">April 25, 2010</div>
      <p>For my next side project I am going to create a webapp that allows site maintainers to track what a user is doing with the UI of their site and view this in realtime. My plan is to record things like mouse position, window size and page content and push it all back to the server. It can be a poor man's usability study or simply used as a big brother tool by site maintainers. Either way it should be interesting.</p>
